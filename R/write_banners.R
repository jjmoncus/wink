#' Export banners to a n excel workbook
#'
#' Takes banners (generated with `banner()`) and prints them to a
#' formatted excel workbook. Each banner is printed to a separate worksheet with appropriate
#' styling, including borders and column dividers. A Table of Contents sheet with
#' hyperlinks is added to the front.
#'
#' @param banners A banner or list of banners, generated with  \code{\link{banner}}
#' @param file (chr) The file path to save the output to. Should include the ".xlsx" extension
#' @param overwrite (lgl) Whether to overwrite an existing file. Default is TRUE. If FALSE, will
#' throw an error a file with the same name already exists.
#' @param format_numbers (lgl) Whether to format numeric values (percentages, n-sizes, etc). per default
#' styling. If TRUE, percentages and n-sizes are formatted to integer values, and design effects and margins of error
#' are formatted to two decimal places.
#'
#' @return Invisibly returns NULL. The function is called for its side effect of creating and writing
#'   an Excel file.
#'
#' The Excel file has several properties:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \strong{Table of Contents}: A dedicated first sheet with hyperlinks to all banners. Each banner also includes a button back to the table of contents.
#'   \item \strong{worksheets}: Each banner is written to a separate sheet, named after the `var` variable used to generate it.
#'   \item \strong{formatting}: Borders are added to separate sections of the table. Numbers are saved and formatted per rules, and text is saved as text.
