# wink 0.0.3

* write_banners() exports numbers as numbers and characters as text
* default formats percentages as integers, deff + mose with 2 decimal places


# wink 0.0.2

* `var_nets` is now order agnostic (fixed lots of bugs related to weird forms)
* `write_banners()` can write just one banner, no need to wrap into list
* labels for by variables are also printed underneath the group header (when available)
* added `exclude_by` and `exclude_var` args for excluding variable levels from the table without affecting significance testing
