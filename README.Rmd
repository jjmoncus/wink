## Overview

A banner is a set of crosstabs of survey estimates stitched together, and with significance testing performed column-by-column within each crosstab.

``` {r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: "asis"
banner(
  data = food,
  var = "pescetarian",
  bys = "age"
)
```

As you add more variables to split by, each new crosstab is added on the end, without disrupting the significance testing results of previous ones.

``` {r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| results: "asis"
banner(
  data = food,
  var = "pescetarian",
  bys = c("age", "income", "gender", "region", "party_lean")
)

```

`wink` provides functionality for generating these banners, specific to each organization's unique preferences, before exporting to a common output format (Excel) for sharing across research teams.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wink from [the GitHub rep](https://github.com/jjmoncus/wink/) with:

``` {r install}
#| message: false 
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

# library(devtools)
install_github("jjmoncus/wink", 
               build_vignettes = TRUE, # helpful to see vignettes, set to FALSE if needed
               force = TRUE  # helpful if you've installed previous versions, forces an override, set to FALSE if needed
                         )
```
