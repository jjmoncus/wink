\title{Create Banner Crosstabs with Statistical Testing}
\usage{
banners(design, target, banners, min_n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A survey design object (typically from the survey package) containing
the survey data and design specifications}

\item{target}{A character string specifying the target variable name to be analyzed
against the banner variables}

\item{banners}{A vector of character strings, where each element represents a banner
variable name to be cross-tabulated with the target variable}

\item{min_n}{An integer specifying the minimum sample size threshold for statistical
testing. Cells with fewer observations may not be included in testing. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the combined crosstab results with the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{col_dividers}: A numeric vector indicating where column divisions occur
\item \code{target}: The target variable name used in the analysis
\item \code{banners}: The list of banner variables used in the analysis
}
The first banner table retains the Target column, while subsequent banner tables
have the Target column removed to avoid duplication.
}
\description{
This function generates multiple crosstabs using banner variables against a target variable,
applying statistical testing across columns. It combines the results into a single table
with appropriate column dividers for presentation.
}
\details{
The function processes each banner variable sequentially, creating crosstabs via
\code{crosstab()} with statistical testing. Statistical testing starts at column B
and progresses through subsequent columns based on the number of columns in each table.

Column dividers are tracked and stored as attributes to facilitate proper formatting
and presentation of the combined results.

# Create a survey design object
library(survey)
design <- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = my_data, weights = ~weight)

# Define banner variables
my_banners <- list("age_group", "gender", "region")

# Generate banner crosstabs
result <- banners(
  design = design,
  target = "satisfaction",
  banners = my_banners,
  min_n = 50

# Access column dividers
